# Literary Expression Algorithm

This repository contains an algorithm that uses literature and linguistic techniques to express meaning and emotion.

## Description

The Literary Expression Algorithm leverages natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and creative writing techniques to generate expressive text. It can be used to create poetry, prose, or other forms of literary expression that convey specific meanings or emotions.

Applications include:

* **Natural Language Processing**: Enhancing text generation with literary techniques.
* **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing and generating text that conveys specific emotions.
* **Creative Writing**: Assisting writers in creating expressive and emotive content.

## Usage

To use the Literary Expression Algorithm, you first need to import the `literary_expression` module. Then, you can create literary expressions by calling the appropriate functions.

Functions include:

* `generate_poem()`: Generates a poem based on given themes or emotions.
* `analyze_sentiment()`: Analyzes the sentiment of a given text.
* `create_prose()`: Creates prose with a specific style or tone.

## Example

The following code generates a poem expressing love and joy:

```python
import literary_expression

themes = ['love', 'joy']
poem = literary_expression.generate_poem(themes)

print(poem)
```

## Documentation

The documentation for the Literary Expression Algorithm is available in the `docs` directory of the repository.

## License
